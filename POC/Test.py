Q1. - General Intro & GenAI projects You have done
2. What challenges you encountered & how resolved
3. How you can build RAG solution using open source models
4. SUppose I give you a PDF, how you build RAG solution
5. Various chunking methods
6. If you have 5000 words & you chunked by 3000 words, and RAG response is not good, what you do?
7. Are you a programmer / work individually, I don't like any manager, I need programmer & contributor (Question comes due to my 16 years of experience) 
 
What happens if we set the chunk size to 500 tokens, and a noun appears at the end of the first chunk, while the next chunk starts with a reference to that noun using a pronoun like 'it'? How does the model retain or understand the context across chunks in this case?
 
Explain the Architecture of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?
 
Please share the techical part of your last project? (your contribution)
 
How will you build the application using open source LLM?
 
These were the questions asked-1) Tell about any Gen AI project you did earlier and what architecture you built from your analysis. Explain.
 2) If you have your name in vector databases and after Embeddings and tokenisation, there was issue of pronouns for your name so how LLM will fix this issue, on what prompt  and how you will fix ...Sol- Chunking overlap and chunk size was not the answer as he was asking what else you can do to fix.
3) Explain Transcriber and what do you know about arch.
 
1.RAG : How do implement solution where you were given a pdf file and you have to query question from it. , Model used for embedding, when we should go for open source and paid pre-trained llm
2. VECTOR DATABASES : how do query from it , when should you go with vector database and normal database , why need of vector database
3. Discuss any gen-ai related past project which you have worked , tools used 


How you can build RAG solution using open source models


JD - 
LLM / AI ML ðŸ¡ª EXPERIENCE in managing Data engg pipeline, strong gen AI expertise including RAG, TRANSCRIBER, REAL TIME INTEGRATION, PYTHON, VECTOR DATABASES. Any experience in building real-time /performant inhouse AI / LLM Solutions would be appreciated


This was for AI/ML
given string like "MynameisDeepthi"..............the output should be without vowels......... "MynmsDpth"(The question was not straight forward, but this is what needs to be done)
given str1=1010 and str2 = 0011............... first reverse substring of str1 with len2(will get str1') and check if it matches str2, if not then reverse str1' with len3 and then check......go on until we get string equal to str2 and return minimum no of changes made to make str1 equals to str2



input n elements with duplicates. Output is list keep odd non duplicates
if n buses travelled one stop1 to another. count the unit travelled by buses



WAP to count how many times the second string appears in the first string, ignoring letter case.
Design an algorithm that give a string and multiple input range [L,R), finds and returns the most frequently occurring characters within each range.
